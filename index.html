  <section id="about-me">
    <h2>Behind BridgeTechia</h2>
    <p>I am Sweety, the Founder of BridgeTechia and a rising high school junior.

The idea of starting BridgeTechia came from my passion for technology and the belief that learning and teaching should be accessible to everyoneâ€”regardless of age or background. Tech Bridge is an open platform where anyone interested in Coding or Artificial Intelligence can joinâ€”whether you're eager to learn or excited to teach.

Iâ€™ve always believed that knowledge grows when it's shared. Thatâ€™s why BridgeTechia is not just a place to study, but a space where learners and educators come together. If you're someone with skills, experience, or insights you'd like to shareâ€”especially with other curious mindsâ€”we warmly welcome you to be a part of BridgeTechia .

Together, letâ€™s create a community where learning has no limits and everyone can grow through collaboration.</p>
